## How to Play A Zombie Life
 
A Zombie Life is a game that uses [ChoiceScript](https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/), a simple programming language that allows anyone to create multiple-choice interactive fiction games. You can play A Zombie Life on your web browser, or download it as an app for your iOS or Android device. The game is free to play online, but you can also purchase it for $2.99 to support the author and unlock some bonus content.
 
The game consists of 12 chapters, each with different scenarios and choices that affect the outcome of the story. You can choose your name, gender, appearance, personality, and skills at the beginning of the game, and customize them further as you progress. You can also check your stats at any time by clicking on the "Show Stats" button at the top of the screen. The stats include:
 
- **Humanity:** How much of your human self you retain. Higher humanity means you are more compassionate, rational, and moral, but also more vulnerable to pain, fear, and guilt. Lower humanity means you are more aggressive, primal, and ruthless, but also more resilient, fearless, and powerful.
- **Zombie:** How much of your zombie self you embrace. Higher zombie means you are more adept at using your undead abilities, such as enhanced senses, strength, speed, and healing. Lower zombie means you are more resistant to the negative effects of being a zombie, such as hunger, decay, and infection.
- **Health:** How physically fit you are. Higher health means you are more likely to survive injuries, diseases, and attacks. Lower health means you are more likely to die or become incapacitated.
- **Hunger:** How hungry you are for human flesh. Higher hunger means you are more driven by your zombie instincts, which can make you stronger but also more reckless and violent. Lower hunger means you are more in control of your appetite, which can make you weaker but also more discreet and civilized.
- **Relationships:** How well you get along with other characters in the game. Higher relationships mean you are more trusted, liked, and respected by others, which can help you gain allies, resources, and information. Lower relationships mean you are more distrusted, disliked, and despised by others, which can lead to conflicts, betrayals, and enemies.

Your choices in the game will affect these stats in various ways. Some choices will increase or decrease one or more stats directly. Other choices will trigger events that will test your stats and determine the outcome. For example, if you choose to fight a zombie horde with a baseball bat, your health stat will determine if you survive or die. If you choose to lie to someone about being a zombie, your humanity stat will determine if they believe you or not.
 
The game also has several achievements that you can unlock by completing certain tasks or reaching certain endings. Some
